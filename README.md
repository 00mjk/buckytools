Go Carbontools
==============

When working large consistent hashing clusters doing simple maintenance can
involve a lot of data moving around.  Normally, one would reach for the
Carbonate tools:

    https://github.com/jssjr/carbonate

These are good tools and I highly recommend them.

However, when the terabytes of WSP files and the number of storage nodes
stack up you start to find scaling problems:

* The python implementation of whisper-fill is slow
* There is no atomic method to rebalance a single metric
  resulting in query inconsistency for possible days after the
  metric was moved
* Handling renames and resulting backfills at scale is still
  difficult

So I wanted to use the speed of Go to build more efficient tools to help
manage large consistent hashing cluster.  Goals:

* Make a whisper-fill compatible binary that's an order of magnitude
  faster
* Make an atomic operation to rebalance or relocate an existing metric
  or close to it
* Build some higher level useful tools for managing a cluster:
  * Build Graphite webui's search index
  * Make arbitrary tar files of metrics
  * List metrics from regex/list
  * Fetch/Ship raw WSP data
  * Find/relocate metrics in the wrong place
  * Rename/backfill from regex or hash/list
  * Restore arbitrary tar files of metrics
  * Sanity, clean empty directories
  * delete metrics from list/regex
  * delete metrics that don't belong on each host
  * tar up metrics that don't belong on each host

Notes
=====

I have a set of tasks written in Fabric that do this for me currently.  They
are slow and poor in many ways.  I want to replace them with this code base.
The Fabric tasks are:

    graphite2.backfill
    graphite2.backfillFromMap
    graphite2.deleteDontBelong
    graphite2.deleteEmptyDirectories
    graphite2.deleteMetrics
    graphite2.migrate
    graphite2.restoreTar
    graphite2.sanity
    graphite2.showDontBelong
    graphite2.showMetrics
    graphite2.tar
    graphite2.tarDontBelong
