The Debian Package buckytools
----------------------------

This package is simply a package around pre-built binaries.  The build process
of this package does not build the Go source.  This package should be
re-made to properly build in pbuilder, however we need newer versions
of the Go compiler and to work on Precise and Trusty.

Perhaps some PPAs or the like might be in order here.
