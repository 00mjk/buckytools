Rebalance is a non-destructive operation that will locate metrics that
are on the wrong server or that have duplicates and will near-atomically
move them to the correct server and backfill as needed.

Use -s to operate on out of place metrics found on the initial host given
by -h or the BUCKYHOST environment variable.  Cluster health is not checked.
Moves that result in metrics that live on a different host will be
completed, so other hosts will be affected even with -s.

Use --no-delete to leave the old metrics in place.  The default is to
remove metrics from their old location after they have been move and
backfilled to the new location.

Set -w to change the number of worker threads used to upload the Whisper
DBs to the remote servers.`
